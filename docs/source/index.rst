The Silent Emergency - Preterm Birth Prediction
===================================


   “The world is facing a silent emergency. . . of preterm births.” - UNICEF

Premature infants, those born before 37 weeks of gestation, are at risk for many negative, long-term health issues. If they survive, they may have difficulties with feeding, breathing, hearing, vision, and neurodevelopment. In The United States there were over 380,000 preterm infants born in 2022, approximately 10% of all births. The highest rates occured among Black women (14.6%), and lowest rates occurred among White women (9.4%) and Hispanic women (10.1%), which is a persistent trend. These rates have recently declined for White women yet remained unchanged for other groups. 

While there are known risk factors for preterm birth, an individual's likelihood of delivering before 37 weeks is not well-understood. 
The etiology of preterm birth is likely a complex interaction between biological, genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors. As of late, there has been increased understanding of social determinants of health and their effects on groups that are systemically disenfranchised. Such racial and ethnic health disparities can be further perpetuated or even exacerbated by underrepresentation of minority groups in healthcare research. It is likely that these environmental factors mediate preterm birth as they do a myriad of other health aspects.  

The current medical system focuses more on mitigation of the health consequences of a preterm birth than on its prediction and prevention. However, machine learning has the potential to support medical professionals with the early identification of a pregnancy likely to proceed to a preterm delivery. Data related to preterm birth can come from sources such as electronic health records, surveys, laboratory results, electrohysterographs, ultrasounds, genome sequences, and other diagnostic procedures. In short, it is noisy. While this is extremely challenging for a human to parse, machine learning models can be trained to identify patterns in large banks of data and to make predictions on new data. 



Therefore, by using a representative dataset and non-invasive metrics, and ensuring our model’s equitable performance across diverse racial and ethnic groups, we aim to contribute to a healthier start for all children.
